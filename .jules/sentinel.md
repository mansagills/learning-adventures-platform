## 2026-01-31 - Mass Assignment Privilege Escalation
**Vulnerability:** The signup endpoint allowed users to specify their role directly in the request body, which was passed unsanitized to `prisma.user.create`. This allowed attackers to create ADMIN accounts.
**Learning:** Using `req.json()` directly into `prisma.create` is dangerous if the model has sensitive fields like `role`.
**Prevention:** Always validate and sanitize input, especially for sensitive fields. Use a whitelist for allowed values (e.g., allow `STUDENT`, `PARENT`, `TEACHER` but not `ADMIN`). Explicitly construct the `data` object instead of spreading the request body.

## 2026-02-01 - Admin Domain Privilege Escalation
**Vulnerability:** The authentication system automatically promotes users with `@learningadventures.org` emails to ADMIN upon login. However, the signup endpoint did not restrict registration with these emails, allowing anyone to register as an attacker and gain ADMIN privileges.
**Learning:** Security logic in one component (auth provider callbacks) can create vulnerabilities if assumptions (e.g., "only admins have these emails") are not enforced in other components (signup).
**Prevention:** Implement defense-in-depth by validating sensitive domains at the signup stage. Ensure that "trusted" identifiers like email domains are actually verified or restricted before granting privileges based on them.

## 2026-02-02 - Missing Defense-in-Depth on Internal APIs
**Vulnerability:** Critical internal API endpoints (e.g., `save-content`) relied solely on middleware for authentication. A bug in the implementation (missing imports) caused security checks to crash, potentially leading to DoS or bypass if fail-open.
**Learning:** Middleware is a good first line of defense, but API routes must also verify authentication explicitly (`getServerSession`). Relying on a single layer is risky. Also, runtime errors in security code can mask vulnerabilities or cause instability.
**Prevention:** Always implement authentication checks inside the API handler for sensitive operations (Defense in Depth). Ensure security-critical code paths are covered by tests that verify they don't crash (Runtime Safety).

## 2023-10-27 - Zip Slip Vulnerability in Content Upload
**Vulnerability:** The `/api/internal/save-content/route.ts` endpoint was vulnerable to Zip Slip due to the fact that it was not verifying that the uploaded ZIP file path actually exists before processing it. In fact, `resolvedZipPath` was undefined and was being used instead of `zipFullPath`.
**Learning:** Even if the extraction mechanism itself is safe (using `extractZipSafely`), failure to correctly reference the sanitized file path (`zipFullPath`) vs an undefined variable (`resolvedZipPath`) can bypass security checks entirely if it fails to resolve properly or throws unchecked errors.
**Prevention:** Always ensure that variables used for path resolution and file existence checks match the validated variables exactly.
