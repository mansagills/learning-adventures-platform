# Learning Adventures Platform - Claude Instructions

## 🚀 Platform Development Sessions

### Current Development Status

**Active Development Plan**: COMPREHENSIVE_PLATFORM_PLAN.md
**Current Phase**: Plan 2 - Frontend Adventure Preview System

### 📋 Development Session Protocol

**IMPORTANT**: When starting any development session, ALWAYS:

1. **Check Development Status**: Read `COMPREHENSIVE_PLATFORM_PLAN.md` to understand current progress
2. **Review Last Completed Phase**: Look for the "COMPLETED" marker in the plan
3. **Continue from Next Phase**: Pick up from the next uncompleted phase/day
4. **Update Progress**: When completing a phase, mark it as "COMPLETED ✅" in the plan
5. **Track Session Work**: Update the plan with detailed progress notes

### 🎯 Session Continuation Instructions

When asked to continue development work:
- Read the comprehensive plan to understand the current state
- Continue from the next uncompleted phase

## Game/Lesson Creation Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: All game creation methods (developer workflow, Gemini Studio, AI Agent Studio, Content Studio) must go through the testing workflow before games reach the public catalog.

### 🎯 Choose Your Creation Method:

#### For Developers:
See `GAME_DEVELOPMENT.md` for the complete React component game development workflow.

#### For Non-Developers (Content Creators, Educators):
See `NON_DEVELOPER_WORKFLOW.md` for AI-powered game creation using:
- **Gemini Studio** - Natural language AI game generation
- **AI Agent Studio** - Multi-agent workflows
- **Content Studio** - Upload existing content

#### For Game Platform Imports (BuildBox, Unity, Construct, etc.):
See `PLATFORM_INTEGRATION.md` for importing games from professional game engines:
- **BuildBox** - HTML5 exports
- **Unity WebGL** - Unity game builds
- **Construct 3** - HTML5 exports
- **GDevelop, GameMaker, Godot** - And 10+ more platforms

All methods route through `/internal/testing` for quality assurance before catalog publication.

### Manual Creation Workflow

When creating new games or lessons manually, follow this specific workflow:

### 📋 Step-by-Step Process
1. **Review content in `games` folder** - Check existing game ideas and patterns
2. **Review content in `interactive-learning` folder** - Check existing lesson ideas and patterns
3. **Review prompts in `final-content/` folders** - Use established prompt templates
4. **Look at README files** - Understand project structure and requirements
5. **Create the games/lessons** - Build HTML or React component files
6. **Upload to the app** - Place files in correct directories
7. **Test in isolated environment** - Add to test games list (see Test Games Workflow below)
8. **Quality assurance** - Run comprehensive testing
9. **Publish to catalog** - Update catalog data with metadata when ready for production

### 🧪 Test Games Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Games can be tested without adding them to the catalog!

**For React Component Games:**
1. Create game in `components/games/[game-name]/`
2. Register in `lib/gameLoader.ts` `initializeGameRegistry()`
3. Add to `docs/test-games.md` with direct URL
4. Test at `http://localhost:3000/games/[game-id]`
5. DO NOT add to `lib/catalogData.ts` until testing is complete

**For HTML Games/Lessons:**
1. Save file to `public/games/` or `public/lessons/`
2. Add to `docs/test-games.md` with direct URL
3. Test at `http://localhost:3000/games/[game-name].html`
4. DO NOT add to `lib/catalogData.ts` until testing is complete

**Key Concept**: Registered ≠ Cataloged
- **Registered**: Game is accessible by URL and can be tested
- **Cataloged**: Game appears in public catalog for all users

**Testing Reference**: See `docs/test-games.md` for complete testing workflow and checklist

    │   └── lessons/                # HTML lesson files
    └── lib/catalogData.ts          # Catalog metadata
```

### 🎯 File Locations for New Content
- **Lessons**: `/learning-adventures-app/public/lessons/[lesson-name].html`
- **Games**: `/learning-adventures-app/public/games/[game-name].html`
- **Catalog Updates**: `/learning-adventures-app/lib/catalogData.ts`

### 🔄 Integration Process
1. Create HTML files in appropriate public directories
2. Add metadata to `catalogData.ts` in the corresponding arrays:
   - Science lessons: `scienceLessons` array
   - Science games: `scienceGames` array
   - Math lessons: `mathLessons` array
   - Math games: `mathGames` array
3. Include required metadata fields:
   - `id`, `title`, `description`, `type`, `category`
   - `gradeLevel`, `difficulty`, `skills`, `estimatedTime`
   - `featured` (boolean), `htmlPath` (for clickable items)

### ✅ Testing Checklist
- [ ] Files accessible at correct URLs
- [ ] Catalog page shows updated count
- [ ] New items appear in featured section (if featured: true)
- [ ] HTML files load and function properly
- [ ] Metadata displays correctly in catalog

### 🎨 Design Patterns to Follow
- Single HTML files with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- Child-friendly, colorful interfaces
- Interactive elements with immediate feedback
- Progress tracking and educational objectives
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility considerations

### 🧪 Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
cd learning-adventures-app
npm run dev

# Test specific lesson/game
curl http://localhost:3000/lessons/[lesson-name].html
curl http://localhost:3000/games/[game-name].html

# Check catalog integration
curl http://localhost:3000/catalog
```

## 📝 Content Creation Guidelines

### For Interactive Lessons:
- Use educational best practices with scaffolded learning
- Include multiple learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Provide immediate feedback and progress tracking
- Follow the lesson prompt template in `final-content/interactive-learning-prompts.txt`

### For Educational Games:
- Balance 70% entertainment with 30% obvious learning
- Include progressive difficulty and achievable challenges
- Provide meaningful choices that affect learning outcomes
- Follow the game prompt template in `final-content/interactive-game-prompts.txt`
