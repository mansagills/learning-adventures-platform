### 65% of US Students Read Below Grade Level

**The education gap is real:**

- Parents want to help but lack tools and visibility into their child's progress
- Teachers need engaging, standards-aligned digital content
- Screen time guilt prevents families from embracing educational technology
- One-size-fits-all instruction fails diverse learners
