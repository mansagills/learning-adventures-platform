- Include multiple learning modalities (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Provide formative assessment opportunities
- Use clear, age-appropriate language

### Technical Requirements
- Single HTML file with embedded CSS and JavaScript
- No external dependencies
- Mobile-responsive design
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- File size optimization for quick loading

## File Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ types.ts                   # TypeScript interfaces
â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ContentCreationForm.tsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ContentPreview.tsx
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ContentPublisher.tsx
â””â”€â”€ services/
    â””â”€â”€ claudeApi.ts           # Claude API integration

app/api/internal/
â”œâ”€â”€ save-content/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ route.ts              # API for saving HTML files
â””â”€â”€ update-catalog/
    â””â”€â”€ route.ts              # API for updating catalog metadata
```

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/internal/save-content`
Saves generated HTML content to the public directory.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "content": "HTML content string",
  "fileName": "content-name.html",
  "type": "game" | "lesson"
}
```

### POST `/api/internal/update-catalog`
Updates the catalog metadata with new content information.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "id": "content-id",
    "title": "Content Title",
    "description": "Content description",
    // ... other metadata fields
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Not Working**
   - Verify your API key is correct in `.env.local`
   - Ensure you have credits in your Anthropic account
   - Check that the key has the necessary permissions

2. **Content Generation Fails**
   - Check browser console for error messages
   - Verify all required form fields are filled
   - Try refreshing the page and starting over

3. **Publishing Fails**
   - Ensure the server has write permissions to the public directory
   - Check that the catalog file is not being used by another process
   - Verify the file path structure matches expectations

### Development Notes

- The Claude API calls are made from the client-side for simplicity
- In production, consider moving API calls to server-side for better security
- The catalog update modifies the source file directly - consider using a database in production
- Content is not versioned - consider adding version control for content management

## Security Considerations

- API keys are exposed to the client-side (development only)
- No authentication/authorization implemented
- Direct file system access from API routes
- Consider adding proper security measures for production use
