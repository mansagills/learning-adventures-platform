## Overview

### What Are Agents?

**Agents** are high-level role specifications that define:
- **Purpose**: What the agent is designed to accomplish
- **Capabilities**: What tasks the agent can perform
- **Workflows**: Step-by-step processes for common tasks
- **Context**: Files, standards, and resources to reference

Think of agents as **job descriptions** for specific content creation roles.

### What Are Skills?

**Skills** are detailed technical specifications that provide:
- **Patterns**: Code templates and structural guidelines
- **Standards**: Quality requirements and validation criteria
- **Checklists**: Step-by-step validation for output quality
- **Examples**: Working code demonstrating best practices

Think of skills as **technical manuals** or **style guides** that ensure consistency.

### Why Both?

Agents provide the **strategic direction** ("what to do and why"), while skills provide the **tactical implementation** ("how to do it correctly"). Together, they ensure:
- âœ… **Consistency**: All content follows the same patterns
- âœ… **Quality**: Built-in validation against platform standards
- âœ… **Efficiency**: No need to reinvent patterns each time
- âœ… **Scalability**: New team members can immediately create compliant content

## Integration Protocols

### Protocol 1: Required Skills (Critical Path)

**Applies to**: Interactive Content Builder, Catalog Integration, Quality Assurance

**Steps**:
1. **READ** the required skill file(s) using the Read tool
2. **UNDERSTAND** all patterns, templates, and validation criteria
3. **APPLY** skill knowledge during content creation
4. **VALIDATE** output against skill checklist before returning
5. **RETURN** compliant content that meets all standards

**Why Critical**: These skills contain non-negotiable platform requirements. Skipping them results in content that fails validation.

**Example**:
```
User: "Create an HTML multiplication game for 3rd graders"

Agent: Interactive Content Builder

Execution:
1. READ docs/skills/educational-game-builder/SKILL.md
2. Extract key requirements:
   - Single HTML file
   - 70/30 fun-to-learning ratio
   - WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Under 3MB file size
3. Create game applying all patterns
4. Self-validate against checklist:
   âœ… Keyboard navigation
   âœ… Color contrast 4.5:1
   âœ… ARIA labels
   âœ… Touch targets 44Ã—44px
   âœ… Responsive layout
5. Return compliant game file
```

---

### Protocol 2: Optional Skills (Enhancement)

**Applies to**: Game Idea Generator

**Steps**:
1. **ASSESS** if technical awareness would enhance output quality
2. **READ** relevant skill(s) if beneficial (optional)
3. **APPLY** patterns as creative inspiration (not constraints)
4. **RETURN** ideas that balance creativity with feasibility

**Why Optional**: Ideation should not be constrained by technical limitations, but awareness of patterns can improve implementability.

**Example**:
```
User: "Generate 5 science game ideas about photosynthesis"

Agent: Game Idea Generator

Execution Path A (Pure Ideation):
1. Research photosynthesis concepts
2. Review existing science games
3. Generate creative concepts
4. Return 5 unique ideas

Execution Path B (Pattern-Aware Ideation):
1. Research photosynthesis concepts
2. Review existing science games
3. READ docs/skills/educational-game-builder/SKILL.md (optional)
4. Generate concepts that fit single HTML file pattern
5. Include technical notes ("Mobile-friendly", "Uses canvas API")
6. Return 5 implementable ideas with technical context
```

## Best Practices

### For Content Creators

1. **Always Start with the Agent**
   - Read the agent documentation first to understand the role
   - Follow the agent's workflow guidance
   - Let the agent direct you to the appropriate skills

2. **Read Skills Before Creating**
   - Don't guess at patterns or standards
   - Read the full skill file, not just the summary
   - Pay special attention to validation checklists

3. **Validate Before Submitting**
   - Self-check against skill validation criteria
   - Test with actual users when possible
   - Run automated tools (Lighthouse, WAVE, etc.)

4. **Iterate Based on Feedback**
   - QA findings should drive improvements
   - Update skills documentation if you discover better patterns
   - Share learnings with the team

### For Skill Maintainers

1. **Keep Skills Updated**
   - Document new patterns as they emerge
   - Update validation criteria when standards change
   - Add examples from real implementations

2. **Make Skills Scannable**
   - Use clear headings and structure
   - Include quick reference checklists
   - Provide code examples for every pattern

3. **Version Control Skills**

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Content Doesn't Match Platform Standards

**Symptom**: Games or lessons fail QA validation

**Diagnosis**: Skills were not read or applied during creation

**Solution**:
1. Read the agent documentation to identify required skills
2. Read the required skills in full
3. Recreate content applying skill patterns
4. Validate against skill checklist before resubmitting

---

### Issue: Catalog Entry Validation Fails

**Symptom**: catalogData.ts throws TypeScript errors

**Diagnosis**: Metadata doesn't match schema in catalog-metadata-formatter skill

**Solution**:
1. READ docs/skills/catalog-metadata-formatter/SKILL.md
2. Compare your entry to the TypeScript schema
3. Fix field names, data types, or missing required fields
4. Validate format (ID lowercase-hyphenated, gradeLevel as array, etc.)

---

### Issue: Accessibility Testing Reveals Many Issues

**Symptom**: QA report shows multiple P0/P1 accessibility violations

**Diagnosis**: Content created without reading accessibility-validator skill

**Solution**:
1. READ docs/skills/accessibility-validator/SKILL.md
2. For each P0/P1 issue, find the corresponding testing category in skill
3. Apply the recommended patterns/fixes from the skill
4. Re-test systematically using skill checklist
5. Only submit when all P0/P1 issues resolved

---

### Issue: Agent Doesn't Know How to Start

**Symptom**: Claude session as agent produces generic output

**Diagnosis**: Agent documentation wasn't read, or skills weren't loaded

**Solution**:
1. Start conversation with: "You are the [Agent Name] agent. Read the agent documentation at docs/agents/[agent-name].md"
2. Wait for agent to acknowledge and identify required skills
3. Confirm agent has read required skills
4. Proceed with task

**Example**:
```
User: "You are the Interactive Content Builder agent. Read your documentation."

Agent: "I've read the Interactive Content Builder documentation. I see I need to read two required skills before creating content:
- docs/skills/educational-game-builder/SKILL.md
- docs/skills/react-game-component/SKILL.md

Let me read those now..."

[Agent reads both skills]

Agent: "I'm now ready to build HTML or React games following platform standards. What would you like me to create?"
```

---

### Issue: Skills and Agent Docs Out of Sync

**Symptom**: Agent references patterns not in skills, or vice versa

**Diagnosis**: Documentation updated in one place but not the other

**Solution**:
1. Identify the source of truth (usually the skill has latest patterns)
2. Update the out-of-sync documentation
3. Verify integration protocol section in agent docs matches skill content
4. Update skills-usage-guide.md if workflows changed
5. Communicate changes to team
