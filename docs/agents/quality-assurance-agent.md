   - Debounce frequent updates

#### Estimated Impact
```typescript
{
  expected: {
    loadTime: '4.2s ‚Üí 2.1s',
    tti: '6.1s ‚Üí 3.8s',

}
```

**Performance Score**: 6/10 (60%) - NEEDS WORK  
**Recommendation**: DO NOT APPROVE - optimize first

3. **Document Everything**: Clear, actionable bug reports
4. **Think Like Users**: Test how children will actually use it
5. **Accessibility First**: Don't leave it as afterthought
6. **Performance Matters**: Optimize for slower devices/connections

## üìù Notes for QA Team

- Test on actual devices when possible, not just DevTools
- Consider cognitive load - what seems simple to adults may confuse children
- Check content in context - how does it fit with other platform content?
- Think about teachers/parents - will they find this valuable?
- Consider edge cases - what if student leaves mid-game?
- Test with actual target age students when possible
- Remember loading states - test on slow connections
- Verify error messages are helpful and encouraging, not discouraging
- Check that achievements trigger at appropriate times
- Ensure progress saves correctly for logged-in users
