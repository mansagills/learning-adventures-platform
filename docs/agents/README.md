## üîó Agent-Skill Integration Matrix

Each agent has been configured to integrate with specific Claude Code skills for enhanced capabilities and consistency.

| Agent | Required Skills | Optional Skills | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Game Idea Generator** | None | educational-game-builder<br>react-game-component<br>accessibility-validator | Optional reference for technical feasibility and pattern awareness |
| **Interactive Content Builder** | educational-game-builder<br>react-game-component | catalog-metadata-formatter | HTML/React game creation following platform standards |
| **Catalog Integration** | catalog-metadata-formatter | None | Ensure proper metadata schema and validation |
| **Quality Assurance** | accessibility-validator | None | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing and validation |

### How It Works:
1. **Each agent's documentation includes a "Skill Integration Protocol" section**
2. **When you invoke an agent role, read the required skills FIRST**
3. **Apply skill patterns and validation checklists to your work**
4. **Return compliant, high-quality output**

### Example:
```
User: "Build an HTML multiplication game"

Step 1: Invoke Interactive Content Builder Agent role
Step 2: READ docs/skills/educational-game-builder/SKILL.md
Step 3: Create game following skill patterns
Step 4: Validate against skill checklist (70/30 ratio, accessibility, etc.)
Step 5: Return compliant game
```

For detailed information on how agents and skills work together, see [Agent-Skill Integration Guide](../workflows/agent-skill-integration.md).

## üîÑ Agent Workflow

The agents work together in a typical content creation flow:

```
1. Game Idea Generator
   ‚Üì (generates concept)

2. Interactive Content Builder ‚Üí READ SKILLS
   ‚Üì (creates game/lesson following skill patterns)

3. Catalog Integration ‚Üí READ SKILL
   ‚Üì (adds to platform with proper metadata)

4. Quality Assurance ‚Üí READ SKILL
   ‚Üì (validates quality against skill standards)

5. ‚úÖ Production Ready
```
