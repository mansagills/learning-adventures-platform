## ðŸŽ® How to Test Games

### For React Component Games:
1. Navigate to the game URL (e.g., `/games/ecosystem-builder`)
2. Play through the entire game
3. Test all features:
   - Score tracking
   - Level progression
   - Achievement system
   - Exit button
   - Pause/Resume (if applicable)
   - Game over state
4. Test on mobile/tablet (responsive design)
5. Use the Quality Assurance agent for comprehensive testing

### For HTML Games/Lessons:
1. Navigate to the HTML file URL (e.g., `/games/multiplication-space-quest.html`)
2. Test all game mechanics
3. Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
4. Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
5. Test responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
6. Use the Quality Assurance agent for WCAG validation

## âž• How to Add a New Test Game

### Adding a React Component Game:

1. **Create the game directory:**
   ```
   components/games/[game-name]/
   â”œâ”€â”€ [GameName].tsx
   â””â”€â”€ index.ts
   ```

2. **Register the game in `lib/gameLoader.ts`:**
   ```typescript
   await import('@/components/games/[game-name]');
   ```

3. **Add to this document** in the "React Component Games" table

4. **Test at:** `http://localhost:3000/games/[game-id]`

5. **DO NOT add to `lib/catalogData.ts` yet** - that's for production!

### Adding an HTML Game/Lesson:

1. **Save HTML file:**
   - Games: `public/games/[game-name].html`
   - Lessons: `public/lessons/[lesson-name].html`

2. **Add to this document** in the appropriate table

3. **Test at:** `http://localhost:3000/games/[game-name].html`

4. **DO NOT add to `lib/catalogData.ts` yet**

## ðŸš€ How to Promote a Game to Production

Once a game passes all tests, follow these steps to make it publicly available:

### Step 1: Use the Catalog Integration Agent

Ask Claude to act as the Catalog Integration agent:
```
"You are the Catalog Integration agent. Add [game-name] to the catalog."
```

The agent will:
- Read the catalog-metadata-formatter skill
- Create proper metadata following the schema
- Add the entry to `lib/catalogData.ts` in the correct category array
- Validate all required fields

### Step 2: Verify Metadata

Ensure the catalog entry has:

**For React Component Games:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'ecosystem-builder',           // Matches game registration ID
  title: 'Ecosystem Builder',
  description: '...',
  type: 'game',
  category: 'science',
  gradeLevel: ['3', '4', '5', '6'],
  difficulty: 'medium',
  skills: ['Food Chains', 'Ecosystem Balance', ...],
  estimatedTime: '15 mins',
  featured: false,                   // Set to true for homepage
  componentGame: true,               // REQUIRED for React games
  // NO htmlPath property
}
```

**For HTML Games/Lessons:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'multiplication-space-quest',
  title: 'Multiplication Space Quest',
  // ... other fields
  htmlPath: '/games/multiplication-space-quest.html',  // REQUIRED
  // NO componentGame property
}
```

### Step 3: Test in Catalog

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/catalog
2. Find the game in the appropriate category
3. Click to launch
4. Verify it opens correctly
5. Test the full gameplay experience

### Step 4: Move from Test to Production

1. **Remove from this document** (test-games.md)
2. **Mark as complete** in your development tracking
3. **Update COMPREHENSIVE_PLATFORM_PLAN.md** if part of a phase
4. **Commit changes** with descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [game-name] to catalog - [category]"
   ```

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- **Test Early, Test Often:** Don't wait until a game is "perfect" to start testing
- **Get Feedback:** Share test URLs with teachers, parents, or students
- **Document Issues:** Keep notes on bugs or improvements needed
- **Use QA Agent:** Let the Quality Assurance agent do comprehensive accessibility testing
- **Version Control:** Commit test games frequently so you can revert if needed
- **Mobile First:** Always test on actual mobile devices, not just browser devtools
