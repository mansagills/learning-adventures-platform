# Child Account Setup Guide

This guide explains how parents can create and manage child accounts on the Learning Adventures platform.

## Understanding Child Accounts

### What Are Child Accounts?
Child accounts are special profiles designed for children (ages 5-12). They feature:
- **Anonymous usernames** - No real names or personal information
- **PIN-based login** - Simple 4-digit code instead of passwords
- **Parental oversight** - Parents control all settings
- **Progress tracking** - Individual learning progress for each child
- **Age-appropriate content** - Filtered based on grade level

### COPPA Compliance
Learning Adventures is fully COPPA-compliant:
- No personal information collected from children
- Parents control all account creation
- Children cannot modify their own profiles
- No direct communication features for children
