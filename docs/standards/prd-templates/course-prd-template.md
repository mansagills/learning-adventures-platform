  title: '[Course Title]',
  description: '[Description]',
  subject: '[math|science|english|history|interdisciplinary]',
  gradeLevel: ['3', '4', '5'],
  difficulty: '[beginner|intermediate|advanced]',
  totalXp: [number],
  estimatedTime: '[X hours]',
  lessonCount: [number],
  isPremium: [true|false],
  imageUrl: '[optional]',
  lessons: [array of lesson references]
}
```

**Course Lesson Record:**
```typescript
{
  id: '[lesson-id]',
  courseId: '[course-id]',
  order: [1, 2, 3...],
  title: '[Lesson Title]',
  type: '[INTERACTIVE|GAME|VIDEO|QUIZ|READING|PROJECT]',
  description: '[Brief description]',
  contentId: '[reference to game/lesson in catalog]',
  xpReward: [number],
  duration: '[X mins]',
  requiredScore: [0-100 or null],

}
```

**Enrollment Record:**
```typescript

  completedAt: [timestamp or null],
  currentLessonId: '[lesson-id]',
  xpEarned: [number],
  progress: [0-100],
  lessonProgress: [array of lesson completion records]
}
```

### Content Files

Each lesson/game in the course needs its own HTML file:

```
/public/games/
├── [course-id]-game-1.html
├── [course-id]-game-2.html
└── ...

/public/lessons/
├── [course-id]-lesson-1.html
├── [course-id]-lesson-2.html
├── [course-id]-quiz-1.html
└── ...
```

### File Naming Convention
- Course ID: `multiplication-mastery`
- Lesson files: `multiplication-mastery-lesson-01.html`
- Game files: `multiplication-mastery-game-01.html`
- Quiz files: `multiplication-mastery-quiz-01.html`

---

## 9. Catalog Metadata

### Course Metadata
```typescript
{
  id: '[course-id]',
  title: '[Course Title]',
  description: '[2-3 sentence description]',
  type: 'course',
  category: '[math|science|english|history|interdisciplinary]',
  gradeLevel: ['3', '4', '5'],
  difficulty: '[beginner|intermediate|advanced]',
