# Learning Objectives Guide

## Overview

Every piece of educational content on Learning Adventures must have clear, measurable learning objectives. Well-written objectives ensure that content is purposeful, assessable, and aligned with educational standards.

**Key Principle**: If you can't measure it, you can't teach it effectively.

## What Makes a Good Learning Objective?

A strong learning objective has these characteristics:

| Characteristic | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| **Specific** | Clearly states what students will learn | ✅ "Multiply two-digit numbers" not ❌ "Understand multiplication" |
| **Measurable** | Can be observed and assessed | ✅ "Identify 5 types of rocks" not ❌ "Know about rocks" |
| **Achievable** | Realistic for the target age/time | ✅ "Add fractions with same denominator" not ❌ "Master all fraction operations" |
| **Relevant** | Connected to broader learning goals | ✅ "Apply multiplication to solve word problems" |
| **Time-bound** | Achievable within the content duration | ✅ "By the end of this game..." |

---

## The ABCD Method

Structure objectives using the ABCD framework:

| Component | Question | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **A**udience | Who is learning? | "Students will..." |
| **B**ehavior | What will they do? | "...identify equivalent fractions..." |
| **C**ondition | Under what circumstances? | "...when shown visual models..." |
| **D**egree | How well? | "...with 80% accuracy." |

### Complete Example

> "Students will identify equivalent fractions when shown visual models (pizza slices, number lines) with 80% accuracy."

## Bloom's Taxonomy Action Verbs

Use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy to ensure objectives are measurable:

## Verbs to AVOID

These verbs are NOT measurable and should not be used:

| Avoid | Why | Use Instead |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Understand | Can't observe "understanding" | Explain, describe, summarize |
| Know | Can't measure "knowing" | Identify, list, state |
| Learn | Too vague | Demonstrate, apply, perform |
| Appreciate | Can't observe appreciation | Describe the value of, explain importance |
| Be familiar with | Not specific | Recognize, identify |
| Be aware of | Not measurable | Describe, list, identify |

✅ "Students will explain three ways recycling benefits the environment."

### Mistake 3: Too Ambitious
❌ "Students will master all multiplication facts in 10 minutes."
✅ "Students will recall multiplication facts for 2 and 5 with 90% accuracy."

### Mistake 4: Multiple Skills in One
❌ "Students will add, subtract, multiply, and divide fractions."
✅ "Students will add fractions with like denominators."
