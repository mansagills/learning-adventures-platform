# Age-Appropriate Content Guide

## Overview

Learning Adventures serves students from Kindergarten through 6th grade (ages 5-12). Content must be carefully designed to match the cognitive, emotional, and developmental stage of each age group.

**Key Principle**: Meet students where they are - not too easy (boring) or too hard (frustrating).
