# Learning Adventures Platform - MVP Development Guide

## Quick Reference for Game and Interactive Lesson Creation

This README serves as a quick reference when asked to create educational games or interactive learning lessons for elementary students.

### 📁 Resource Locations

**Interactive Learning Ideas:**
- Path: `../interactive-learning/math-ideas.txt`
- Path: `../interactive-learning/science-ideas.txt`

**Game Ideas:**
- Path: `../games/math-game-ideas.txt`
- Path: `../games/science-game-ideas.txt`

**Development Prompts:**
- Interactive Lessons: `../final-content/interactive-learning-prompts.txt`
- Educational Games: `../final-content/interactive-game-prompts.txt`

**Finished Content Storage:**
- Completed Games: `../final-content/finished-games/`
- Completed Lessons: `../final-content/finished-lessons/`

### 🎯 When Creating Content

**ALWAYS:**
1. Read the appropriate ideas file first to understand the concept
2. Use the corresponding prompt file for development guidelines
3. Create single HTML files with embedded CSS and JavaScript
4. Follow elementary education best practices (2024-2025)
5. Ensure mobile-responsive design
6. Include immediate feedback and progress tracking
7. Make content accessible (WCAG guidelines)
8. Keep file sizes under 2-3MB for fast loading

**Target Audience:** Elementary students (grades K-5)

### 🔧 Technical Requirements

- **Format:** Single HTML file per lesson/game
- **Dependencies:** None (no external libraries)

### 🚀 Quick Start Process

1. **Identify Request Type:** Game vs. Interactive Lesson
2. **Check Subject:** Math vs. Science
3. **Read Ideas File:** Get inspiration and context
4. **Use Prompt File:** Follow development guidelines
5. **Create Single HTML File:** Implement with best practices
6. **Test & Validate:** Ensure educational and technical requirements met
7. **Save Finished Content:** Place completed HTML file in appropriate folder:
   - Games → `../final-content/finished-games/`
   - Lessons → `../final-content/finished-lessons/`

### 💡 Remember

This platform is designed to make learning fun and engaging for elementary students while maintaining educational rigor and following current best practices in elementary education and HTML5 game development.
